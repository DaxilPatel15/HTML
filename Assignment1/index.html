        <p>Let's go
[Verse 1: Travis Scott & Kid Cudi]<br>
We see the hype outside (Yeah)<br>
Right from the house, uh<br>
Took it straight from outside (Yeah)<br>
Straight to the couch (Mmm)<br>
We runnin' the scouts (Mmm)<br>
They never leave (Mmm)<br>
'Cause that what I bleed (Mmm)<br>
Like she from the street (Mmm)<br>
We heard that your way went dry (Yeah)<br>
We floodin' the drought, uh (Mmm)<br>
We added some routes (Mmm)<br>
You lettin' THE SCOTTS outside (Mmm)<br>
We runnin' the scouts<br>
