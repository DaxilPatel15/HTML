       <p>Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins is a platforming game for the Game Boy released in 1992 and later for the Nintendo 3DS's Virtual Console in 2011. It is the direct sequel to Super Mario Land and also marks the debut of Mario's self-proclaimed arch rival Wario, who would later become a recurring character in the Mario series as well as a protagonist in his own series. Like its predecessor, it received a Player's Choice and was produced by the late Gunpei Yokoi rather than the Mario series creator Shigeru Miyamoto, who was not involved in the development of this game. It is notable for having been the last original side-scrolling Mario game until 2006's New Super Mario Bros.,
